    CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python


This repository contains my solutions to the projects from [CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/) by Harvard University.  

The course explores foundational concepts of artificial intelligence and applies them using Python through hands-on projects.
